# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
This section was actually quite intuitive. The only thing I struggled with was understanding the difference between calling kay-values when the keys have hash rockets vs : (can't remember the name in Ruby)

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
I'm backfilling notes, reading my old ones and bolstering them when something is even cleared than before

- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
Definitely trying to solve it on my own first. It's alway something dumb, like ==, commas, capitalized methods, etc.
